# Phl Hood Reporter

A dirt simple web application that reports what Philadelphia neighborhood you're in.

The app retrieves your geocoordinates and uses the [philly-hoods](https://github.com/davewalk/philly-hoods) API to determine what neighborhood you're currently in.

## Why?

Wow friends with an expert knowledge of the nuanced boundaries between Kensington and Port Richmond! Prove that Cedar Park is not Spruce Hill!
